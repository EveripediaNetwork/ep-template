            Welcome to IQ.Wiki, the website and online service of Distributed
            Machines Inc. (&quot;IQ.wiki,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot;
            or &quot;our&quot;). This page explains the terms by which you may
            use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software
            provided on or in connection with the IQ.Wiki service (collectively
            the &quot;Service&quot;). By accessing or using the Service, you
            (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;), signify that you have read,
            understand and agree to be bound by the terms of service and
            conditions set forth below (as amended from time to time,
            &quot;Terms&quot;) and to the collection, use, and disclosure of
            your information as set forth in our Privacy Policy, as modified
            from time to time and which is incorporated by reference herein.
            These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access the
            Service (&quot;Users&quot;). If you are a United States Federal
            Agency, this Amendment is applied to the Terms of Service. We
            provide the Service for your use subject to the following Terms. We
            reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change or modify
            portions of these Terms at any time. If we modify these Terms, we
            will post a notice at the top of our Service for a period of seven
            (7) days. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your
            acknowledgement of, acceptance of, and agreement to the revised
            Terms. You agree to periodically visit this page to review the
            current Terms so you are aware of any revision to which you are
            bound. We will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms
            were last revised. If you do not agree to abide by these or any
            future Terms, do not use or access (or continue to use or access)
            the Service. IQ.wiki allows you to upload images, files, and other
            media. You agree to only upload images that you have the necessary
            licenses, and permissions, and rights, or that are in the public
            domain, or that you own. You must agree not to upload any
            copyrighted image unless you were permitted by the owner of the
            image or you are legally otherwise entitled to upload the image.
            IQ.wiki takes no responsibility for any liability you may or may not
            incur from uploading images for which you do not have the necessary
            licenses, permissions, and/or rights. Additional terms and
            conditions may apply to certain services provided by IQ.wiki, and
            you agree that you shall be subject to any additional terms
            applicable to such services that may be posted on the Website or
            otherwise made available to you from time to time. All such terms
            are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. PLEASE READ
            THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.
            THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS
            ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF
            ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN
            JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. THE SERVICE MAY CONTAIN CONTENT THAT
            IS INACCURATE, OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN, OR
            OTHERWISE UNSUITED TO YOUR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT IQ.wiki SHALL
            NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU ALLEGE IN INCUR AS A RESULT OF ANY
