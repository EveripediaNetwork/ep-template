            IQ.wiki takes pride in being an inclusive platform for the
            cryptocurrency community. That said, there are a few
            editorial-related policies / do&apos;s and don&apos;t&apos;s we
            believe everyone should follow.

                <b>Write about cryptocurrency-related topics:</b> IQ.wiki is a
                cryptocurrency encyclopedia so feel free to create quality wikis
                about any topic that&apos;s related to crypto. To maintain the
                quality of the encyclopedia all pages must be cited and at least
                300 words. Each page should have some significance and relevance
                to the crypto community.

                <b>Write in a third-person, objective tone:</b> Because IQ.wiki
                is a knowledge base, one of the precedents we have set is to
                think from the perspective of an academic scholar. When editing
                an IQ.wiki article, ask yourself, &quot;Would this be considered
                an objective resource if someone else read this?&quot;

                <b>Cite your sources where needed:</b> It is important for
                IQ.wiki&apos;s platform to present accurate information. To make
                it easier for contributors and readers alike to see where
                editors get their information from (and the validity of those
                resources), it is important to cite their sources. This allows
                the community to checks editor&apos;s work and work with editors
                in an environment that is inherently collaborative.

                first and foremost a cryptocurrency wiki. All articles on the

                community. Articles that are not related to cryptocurrency or
